* Edit the makefile and set INSTALLDIR according to your taste
* make
* su
* make install
* (optional:) make cleanall

If LIBDIR is not a standard library directory (/lib, /usr/lib and those
listed in /etc/ld.so.conf), you should set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to LIBDIR or
include LIBDIR in /etc/ld.so.conf and run /sbin/ldconfig.

Have fun!
